Mac App Store for PowerPC Mac

This is a proof of concept App Store for PowerPC Mac.  At the moment, it uses Macintosh Garden as a source - but it could use any repository as a source.

It is being built on Leopard, using APIs for Mac OS X 10.0 in order to open it up to the widest possible audience.

When complete, it will make recommendations for software that all Macs should have installed including, but not limited to:
* Clam XAV
* VLC
* TextWrangler
* CyberDuck
* Locamatic

I encourage anyone to make updates to this code - and also, perhaps, to port it to Classic so that 68k Macs can benefit too.
